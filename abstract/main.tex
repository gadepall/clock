In this paper the design and implementation of a feature-rich digital clock is demonstrated. The system uses multiplexing to drive six seven-segment displays efficiently, minimizing I/O utilization. Key functionalities include timekeeping, digit-by-digit editing, and pause/play control. Boolean-based increment and decrement logic ensures more accurate cascading of seconds, minutes, and hours within standard constraints. The hardware setup, complemented by software debouncing and display refreshing, demonstrates a reliable, compact, and user-interactive digital clock suitable for both educational and practical applications.
