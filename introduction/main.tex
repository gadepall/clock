\section{Introduction}
The digital clock system described here implements a feature-rich clock with editing capabilities using an Arduino microcontroller. The system utilizes a multiplexing technique to display time on six seven-segment displays using minimal I/O pins. This implementation includes pause/play functionality and digit-by-digit editing with increment and decrement buttons.
