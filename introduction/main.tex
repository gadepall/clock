\section{Introduction}
Digital timekeeping has long been a critical component of electronic system design, with classical digital design principles thoroughly discussed in foundational works such as [1], [2], and [3]. The advent of microcontroller platforms, particularly Arduino, has enabled the development of compact, programmable clocks with enhanced user interactivity [4]. Techniques such as BCD-to-seven-segment interfacing and display multiplexing allow efficient utilization of limited I/O resources while maintaining accurate visual representation [5]. Inspired by these principles, this work presents an Arduino-based digital clock featuring six-digit multiplexed displays, pause/play functionality, and digit-by-digit editing with Boolean logic-driven increment and decrement operations.
