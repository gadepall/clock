\section{Future Work}
The clock prototype on the Arduino is the first step towards building a chip.  The next step is to adapt the current design for implementation on a Vaman FPGA with a QuickLogic SoC and use additional EDA tools for physical chip design.  
Many real time issues like flicker or timing drift will also be considered in the process and will be addressed in future work.

\begin{itemize}
\item Integration with wireless modules (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote time setting and synchronization.
\item Addition of alarms, timers, and countdown features with user-defined events.
\item Implementation of a real-time clock (RTC) module for improved accuracy and power efficiency.
\item Expansion to a multi-language or multi-format (12/24-hour) display interface.
\item Incorporation of IoT functionality for smart home or wearable applications.
\item Some real time issues like flicker or timing drift have not been considered in this paper and will be addressed in future work.
