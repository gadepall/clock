\section{Future Work}
The clock prototype on the Arduino is the first step towards building a chip.  The next step is to adapt the current design for implementation on a Vaman FPGA with a QuickLogic SoC and use additional EDA tools for physical chip design.  This will be done in future work.

\begin{itemize}
\item Integration with wireless modules (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote time setting and synchronization.
\item Addition of alarms, timers, and countdown features with user-defined events.
\item Implementation of a real-time clock (RTC) module for improved accuracy and power efficiency.
\item Expansion to a multi-language or multi-format (12/24-hour) display interface.
\item Incorporation of IoT functionality for smart home or wearable applications.
\end{itemize}
